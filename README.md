# PX-Ed
PX-Ed is a project done as a part of our CSE 408 project. It is basically an ed-tech platform with pre-recorded courses, exams and leaderboards.
To run this, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies and libraries, run the django server and finally run npm start.
Details are coming soon.
